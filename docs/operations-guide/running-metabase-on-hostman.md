# Running Metabase on Hostman 

Hostman is an easy way to start using Metabase in the Cloud. The one-click installation allows you to start analyzing and visualizing your data right away.

### Launching Metabase 

To start using Metabase you need to have a [Hostman](https://hostman.com/) account. 
If you don't have one, please, sign up [here](https://test.hostman.com/marketplace/metabase/).

After you enter your email, the deployment of Metabase will start automatically. It usually takes about a minute to build Metabase on your account. 
You can check on the progress in your [Dashboard](https://dashboard.hostman.com/).

You'll get a notification when the build finishes. Now all you need to do is to configure Metabase according to your needs. 

Click "Get started with Metabase" button and start [setting up Metabase](https://www.metabase.com/docs/latest/setting-up-metabase.html). 

### Troubleshooting

If you have any questions or your Metabase instance is getting stuck part way through the initialization process, please contact us in [chat](https://hostman.com/). We're available 24/7.
